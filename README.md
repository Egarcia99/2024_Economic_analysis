# Economic Analysis for 2023-2024

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to analyzing key economic indicators for 2023-2024, using data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) service. The notebook is structured with code written in Python and explanations in Markdown, facilitating an interactive and educational exploration of economic trends.

## Data Visualizations
The Jupyter Notebook, `Economic-Analysis.ipynb`, includes several visualizations:

### S&P 500 Index
- **Graph Description**: This plot displays the S&P 500 index trends over 2023 and 2024, providing insights into the stock market's performance during this period. The data is fetched directly from FRED using the API and plotted using matplotlib for a clear visual representation.

### Unemployment Rates by State
- **Graph Description**: This visualization shows the unemployment rates across different states, highlighting regional economic conditions. The data is segmented by state, allowing for a detailed comparison of employment health across the country.

### GDP and Inflation Rate Comparison
- **Graph Description**: This comparative analysis helps to visualize the relationship between GDP growth and inflation rates. The graph plots both indicators to examine how inflation correlates with economic growth, using dual y-axes to facilitate comparison.

### Economic Analysis Specifics
- **2024 Analysis**: The notebook specifically focuses on analyzing the economic indicators for the year 2024, providing predictions and trends based on the latest available data from FRED.

## Prerequisites
To view and interact with the notebook, you will need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. The analysis uses libraries such as `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `plotly`, which are essential for data manipulation and visualization.

## Usage
- **API Key Requirement**: To fetch data from the FRED API, an API key is necessary. You can obtain this key by registering on the FRED website and inserting it into the notebook where indicated.
- **Running the Notebook**: Open `Economic-Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to activate the data fetching processes and view the results.
